# Heart Disease Binary Classification

This is a algorithm designed to identify the presence of heart disease in a patient given a number of health indicators.  The algorithm had a relatively high degree of accuracy and recall using a small training dataset.

The purpose of this project was to learn more about EDA and visualizations, as well as how to interpret the results from the models.

The notebook is diveded into sections detailing the actions being taken.

The data is collected From UCI's Heart Disease Data Set.  The notebook imports the data from ZeroToMastery's github, which is a course I took in the past.
