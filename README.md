# Heart Disease Binary Classification

This is a algorithm designed to identify the presence of heart disease in a patient given a number of health indicators.  The algorithm had a relatively high degree of accuracy and recall using a small training dataset.

The notebook is diveded into sections detailing the actions being taken.

The data is collected From UCI's Heart Disease Data Set.  The notebook imports the data from ZeroToMastery's github, which is a course I took in the past.

# Hi, I'm John! ðŸ‘‹


## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm a business analyst at a major health insurance organization.  I'm very interested in data science as a tool to turn data into digestable information that people want to learn about.  I've worked in healthcare for over half a decade, but I also hold interests in music, cooking, and housing.

I've been spending the last year and a half learning Python, SQL, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn in my free time to improve my data analysis and data science skills.  While I continue to build those skills, I've been learning recently about Tableau, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.
